          <h2> Objective</h2>

          <p>To obtain a position that combines my expertise in slacking off, causing chaos, and occasionally pulling off big wins. Seeking a role where my natural flair for mischief and creative problem-solving can be put to good use. Looking for a laid-back work environment with a team that understands the value of having fun while getting things done (sometimes).</p>

                    <li>Assisted in various (questionable) park-related events, like dodgeball tournaments and wrestling matches.</li>

                    <li>Occasionally saved the day (by accident) in times of park-wide disasters.</li>

                    <li>Negotiated multiple "extended lunch breaks" with Mordecai and other coworkers.</li>

                    <li>Perfected the art of procrastination without getting caught (most of the time).</li>
